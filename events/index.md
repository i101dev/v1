# Swan Events

Swan Events are significant occurrences that affect the region. Every operation, every market manipulation, every attack generates events that can be detected and investigated.

## What Are Swan Events?

Swan Events represent anything notable that happens in the game world:

- Military operations (HUNT, RAID, KDNP, etc.)
- Economic incidents (market crashes, supply disruptions)
- Environmental disasters
- Rogue agent attacks
- Player-initiated attacks

**Every action creates ripples.** Swan Events are those ripples made visible.

## Detection

### By Intelligence Tier

| Intel Tier | Detection Capability |
|------------|---------------------|
| Tier 0 | See only cover stories |
| Tier 1 | Surface-level anomalies |
| Tier 2 | Attack methodology |
| Tier 3 | Full pattern analysis |

### Public vs Private Events

Some events are visible to everyone (large explosions, market crashes). Others require intel investment to detect (covert operations, infiltrations).

## Types of Swan Events

### Operational
Generated by military operations:
- Card executions (HUNT, RAID, HIJK, KDNP, RSCU, PRED)
- Convoy interceptions
- Building attacks

### Environmental
Random or triggered disasters:
- Infrastructure failures
- Natural disasters
- Supply chain disruptions

### Rogue
Autonomous hostile actors:
- Rogue agent spawning
- Rogue attacks on infrastructure
- Escalating threat patterns

### Economic
Market-related events:
- Price manipulation detected
- Supply shortages
- FOREX disruptions

## Investigation

Every Swan Event generates an **evidence catalog** with three tiers:

| Evidence Tier | Access | Content |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| Tier 1 | Intel 1+ | Basic inconsistencies |
| Tier 2 | Intel 2+ | Attack methodology |
| Tier 3 | Intel 3 | Perpetrator identification |

Investigations reveal the truth behind cover stories.

## ROE and Legal Exposure

Every operation generates a Swan Event. **Rules of Engagement (ROE)** determine:

- Detection likelihood
- Legal exposure to Imperial authorities
- Potential for collateral damage

**ROE does NOT determine whether an event occurs**—all operations generate events.
