# Investigations

Investigations reveal the truth behind Swan Events. Your intelligence tier determines what evidence you can access and how accurately you can identify perpetrators.

## How Investigations Work

1. **Swan Event occurs** (attack, disaster, etc.)
2. **Player initiates investigation**
3. **Results delivered immediately** (no processing time)
4. **Evidence revealed** based on intel tier

## Evidence Tiers

Every Swan Event generates a complete evidence catalog:

| Evidence Tier | Access | Content Type |
|---------------|--------|--------------|
| Tier 1 | Intel 1+ | Basic inconsistencies |
| Tier 2 | Intel 2+ | Attack methodology, forensics |
| Tier 3 | Intel 3 | Perpetrator identification |

### Tier 1 Examples
- "Structural damage inconsistent with gas explosion"
- "Timeline discrepancies between reports"
- "Blast radius exceeds accidental parameters"

### Tier 2 Examples
- "Explosive residue: Military-grade C4"
- "Bullet casings: 7.62x39mm, military issue"
- "Entry method indicates professional training"

### Tier 3 Examples
- "Perpetrator identified: Rogue Agent 'Phantom'"
- "Perpetrator identified: Syndicate [name]"
- "Conclusive evidence: Genuine structural failure"
- "Next attack predicted: Cycle 147, Tile 234"

## Investigation Outcomes

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Genuine accident | "Conclusive evidence of accident" |
| Rogue agent | Identity revealed (25%/75%/100% by tier) |
| Player attack (non-DOTC) | Syndicate identified → Hit List |
| Player attack (all-DOTC) | "Inconclusive evidence" |

## TFA Authorization

Successful identification grants legal authorization:

| Identification | TFA Type | Scope | Duration |
|----------------|----------|-------|----------|
| Rogue agent | HRA | Target-specific | Unlimited |
| Player syndicate | IHL | Victim-only | 7 cycles |

## Perpetrator Identification

### Rogue Agents

| Intel Tier | ID Chance |
|------------|-----------|
| Tier 1 | ~25% |
| Tier 2 | ~75% |
| Tier 3 | 100% |

### Player Syndicates

**Only possible if attacker used non-DOTC operatives.**

- All-DOTC attacks = "Inconclusive"
- Any non-DOTC operative = Potential identification
- Higher intel tier = More reliable attribution

## Detritus Evidence

Physical items at attack sites provide forensic value:

| Type | Evidence Value |
|------|----------------|
| Spent ordnance | Weapon signatures |
| Equipment fragments | Manufacturing IDs |
| Biological samples | DNA, chemicals |
| Digital artifacts | Cyber signatures |

**Recovering detritus provides:**
- Raw materials for salvage
- Forensic evidence for investigations
- Tradeable intelligence assets

## Strategic Use

### Defensive
- Investigate all attacks on your assets
- Build case for TFA authorization
- Identify threats before escalation

### Offensive
- Frame enemies by leaving evidence
- Trigger investigations against rivals
- Exploit Imperial enforcement

### Counter-Intelligence
- Use DOTC operatives for deniability
- Leave false evidence trails
- Manipulate investigation outcomes
