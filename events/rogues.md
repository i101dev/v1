# Rogue Agents

Rogue agents are autonomous hostile actors that spawn from failed operations or collateral damage. They create ongoing threats that must be identified and eliminated.

## How Rogues Spawn

Rogues can spawn from:

- **Failed covert operations** that cause collateral damage
- **High-severity Swan Events** with civilian casualties
- **Uncontrolled escalation** of regional conflicts

**Military Tier 3 Damage Control** reduces rogue spawn probability by limiting Swan Event severity.

## Rogue Behavior

Once spawned, rogue agents:

1. **Target infrastructure** in the region
2. **Attack periodically** (every few cycles)
3. **Escalate over time** if not eliminated
4. **Cannot be negotiated with**

They're autonomous threats that grow more dangerous when ignored.

## Detection

### By Intelligence Tier

| Intel Tier | Rogue ID Chance | Threat Warning |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Tier 0 | 0% | None |
| Tier 1 | ~25% | None |
| Tier 2 | ~75% | 1 cycle |
| Tier 3 | **100%** | 2 cycles + target prediction |

### Tier 3 Target Prediction

At Intelligence Tier 3, you can predict:
- Which tile the rogue will attack next
- When the attack will occur

This enables **preemptive defense** rather than reactive response.

## Elimination

### Investigation
1. Investigate Swan Events caused by rogue
2. Identify rogue agent (by intel tier)
3. Receive **HRA (Hostile Rogue Agent) authorization**

### Terminal Force Authorization

| Authorization | Scope | Duration |
|---------------|-------|----------|
| HRA | Target-specific | Unlimited |

HRA authorizes military action against the identified rogue without Imperial sanction.

### Hunting
- Deploy operations against rogue location
- Higher training = higher success rate
- Intel investment = better tracking

## Strategic Implications

### Prevention
- Military Tier 3 Damage Control reduces spawn rates
- Careful ROE selection on operations
- Avoid civilian casualties

### Response
- Intel investment for early detection
- Rapid elimination before escalation
- Coordinate with allies for regional threats

### Exploitation
- Rogues attack **everyone**—including enemies
- Let rogues weaken competitors before eliminating
- Time intervention for maximum advantage
