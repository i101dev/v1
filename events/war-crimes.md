# War Crimes & TFA

The Imperial authorities enforce rules of engagement. Excessive collateral damage or attacks on protected targets can result in sanctions and legal consequences.

## Terminal Force Authorization (TFA)

TFA is the legal framework for military action. Operating without authorization risks Imperial intervention.

### TFA Types

| Authorization | Trigger | Scope | Duration |
|---------------|---------|-------|----------|
| **HRA** | Rogue agent identified | Target-specific | Unlimited |
| **IHL** | Player syndicate identified | Victim-only retaliation | 7 cycles |

### HRA (Hostile Rogue Agent)
- Granted when investigation identifies a rogue agent
- Authorizes unlimited action against that specific target
- No expiration

### IHL (Imperial Hit List)
- Granted when investigation identifies an attacking syndicate
- Only the **victim** can retaliate
- Expires after **7 cycles**
- Escalation beyond scope triggers sanctions

## Sanctions

The Empire can impose sanctions for:

- **Unauthorized operations** (no TFA)
- **Excessive collateral damage**
- **Attacks on protected targets**
- **IHL scope violations**

### Sanction Effects

| Sanction | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Commodity embargo | Cannot purchase from Imperial Marketplace |
| Contract blacklist | Cannot claim defense contracts |
| FOREX restrictions | Limited or no inter-regional trade |

### Lifting Sanctions
- Time-based expiration
- Tribute payment to Empire
- Diplomatic resolution

## DOTC Deniability

**DOTC-trained operatives provide operational deniability.**

If ALL operatives in an attack are DOTC-trained:
- Investigation returns "Inconclusive"
- No perpetrator identification
- No IHL addition
- No sanctions

This is why DOTC training is valuable beyond combat bonuses.

## Rules of Engagement

### ROE Levels

| ROE | Collateral Risk | Legal Exposure |
|-----|-----------------|----------------|
| Surgical | Minimal | Low |
| Standard | Moderate | Medium |
| Overkill | High | High |

### ROE Selection

- **Surgical:** Slower, more expensive, legally clean
- **Standard:** Balanced risk/reward
- **Overkill:** Fast, cheap, legally dangerous

### Damage Control (Military Tier 3)

Tier 3 provides **Damage Control Protocols**:
- -30% Swan Event severity
- Reduced rogue spawn probability
- Limits catastrophic consequences

Enables aggressive operations with manageable risk.

## Strategic Considerations

### Operating Clean
- Invest in DOTC training for deniability
- Use surgical ROE for sensitive operations
- Maintain good Imperial standing

### Operating Dirty
- Accept sanction risk for speed advantage
- Use overkill ROE when time-critical
- Plan for sanction period survival

### Framing Enemies
- Execute attacks that trigger RED retaliation
- Create evidence pointing to rivals
- Let Imperial system punish your enemies
