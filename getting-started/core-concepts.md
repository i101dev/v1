# Core Concepts

Before diving into specific systems, understand these fundamental concepts that govern everything in Syndicate Protocol.

## Regions & Sectors

The game world is divided into **Regions**. Each region contains a grid of **Sectors**.

- **Sectors** are the basic unit of territory
- Sectors contain **Tiles** where buildings and resources exist
- Control a sector by building a **Fortress** in it
- Controlled sectors let you extract resources and place buildings

## Resources vs Commodities

Two different economic layers:

### Resources (Raw Materials)
| Resource | Symbol | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Energy | ENGY | Power plants, extractors |
| Minerals | MINR | Mining operations |
| Water | WATR | Purification facilities |

Resources are **extracted** from controlled territory and used to manufacture commodities.

### Commodities (Manufactured Goods)
| Commodity | Symbol | Effect |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Medical | MEDS | Citizen health, QOL |
| Ammunition | AMMO | Military operations |
| Food | FOOD | Citizen sustenance, QOL |
| Tools | TOOLS | Production efficiency |

Commodities affect your syndicate's **Quality of Life (QOL)**, which impacts everything from combat effectiveness to citizen productivity.

## The Tier System

Three parallel progression tracks that unlock capabilities and provide bonuses:

### Finance Tier
- Access to advanced market operations
- FOREX trading capabilities
- ITSB credit line expansion
- Contract types

### Military Tier
- Mercenary training speed bonuses
- Operation card unlocks
- Combat effectiveness multipliers
- QRF capabilities

### Intelligence Tier
- Detection range and accuracy
- Counter-intelligence capabilities
- Investigation depth
- Infiltration options

**Critical:** Tiers compound. A 10% bonus at tier 3 applied over 50 cycles is massive. Early tier investment pays dividends.

## Citizens & Labor

Citizens are your workforce. They're recruited, trained, and assigned to buildings.

- **Recruitment** — Acquire new citizens
- **Assignment** — Place citizens in buildings to operate them
- **Training** — Improve citizen effectiveness
- **CERC Value** — Each citizen has a value that contributes to your portfolio

Buildings without citizens don't function. Citizens are both workers and assets.

## Mercenaries & Operations

Military power comes from **Mercenaries**—trained soldiers who execute operations.

### Training Pipeline
Mercenaries progress through 10 training stages (RIP → GBQC). Each stage unlocks new operation types and improves effectiveness.

### Operation Cards
Military actions are executed via **Cards**:
- **HUNT** — Target EXOT resources
- **RAID** — Attack enemy assets
- **HIJK (Hijack)** — Intercept convoys
- **KDNP (Kidnap)** — Capture enemy citizens
- **RSCU (Rescue)** — Recover captured assets
- **PRED (Predator)** — Drone strikes

Each card requires trained mercenaries and consumes resources.

## Swan Events

**Swan Events** are significant occurrences that affect the region. Every operation, every market manipulation, every attack generates events.

- Swan Events are **visible** to syndicates based on their Intelligence Tier
- Some events are **public** (everyone sees them)
- Some events are **private** (only detected by high-intel syndicates)

Your ability to see Swan Events before others is a major competitive advantage.

## Protocol Syndicates (AI Houses)

Four AI-controlled syndicates operate in every region:

| House | Color | Behavior |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **BLU** | Blue | Resource hoarder, market monopolist |
| **GRN** | Green | Aggressive hunter, market disruptor |
| **RED** | Red | Defender, justice enforcer |
| **YLW** | Yellow | Profit maximizer, opportunist |

These houses respond to game events through **Playbooks**—automated response systems that trigger contracts and operations based on conditions.
