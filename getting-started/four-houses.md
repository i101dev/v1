# The Four Houses

Four AI-controlled syndicates—called **Protocol Syndicates**—operate in every region. They're not background decoration. They trade, attack, defend, and respond to your actions. Understanding their behaviors is essential to survival.

## Overview

| House                                  | Archetype  | Core Drive            | Playstyle                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| <span class="house-blu">**BLU**</span> | The Player | Resource accumulation | Monopolize, hoard, build  |
| <span class="house-grn">**GRN**</span> | The Wolf   | Harm others           | Hunt, disrupt, exploit    |
| <span class="house-red">**RED**</span> | The Knight | Protect peace         | Punish aggressors, defend |
| <span class="house-ylw">**YLW**</span> | The Pimp   | Currency accumulation | Profit, arbitrage, trade  |

## House Behaviors

### BLU — The Player

**Philosophy:** "Own everything."

BLU syndicates focus on **resource monopolization**. They corner markets, stockpile commodities, and build extensive infrastructure.

**What to expect:**

-   Aggressive market buying, especially when prices dip
-   Heavy investment in production buildings
-   Territorial expansion to control extraction sites
-   Issues objectives for intel and sabotage

**How to counter:**

-   Compete for extraction sites early
-   Crash markets BLU is stockpiling
-   Target their supply convoys

---

### GRN — The Wolf

**Philosophy:** "Watch the world burn."

GRN syndicates are **predators**. They hunt for sport, disrupt operations, and exploit chaos.

**What to expect:**

-   Frequent HUNT and RAID operations
-   Market manipulation to create volatility
-   Targeting weak or exposed syndicates
-   Opportunistic attacks during other conflicts

**How to counter:**

-   Maintain defensive QRF posture
-   Keep intel tier high to see attacks coming
-   Don't look weak—GRN targets the vulnerable
-   Fill RED defense objectives for protection

---

### RED — The Knight

**Philosophy:** "Justice through force."

RED syndicates are **reactive defenders**. They punish aggressors and protect civilians.

**What to expect:**

-   Retaliation against anyone who attacks civilians
-   Elimination objectives against aggressive syndicates
-   Defensive positioning around non-combatants
-   Intervention in ongoing conflicts

**How to counter:**

-   Don't trigger RED—avoid civilian casualties
-   If you need military action, be surgical
-   Fill RED defense objectives for protection against GRN
-   RED won't attack unprovoked

**Special:** RED objectives are a **second CRD supply source**. When RED issues elimination objectives, payments create new credits, causing regional inflation.

---

### YLW — The Pimp

**Philosophy:** "Everything has a price."

YLW syndicates are **pure capitalists**. They maximize profit through arbitrage, trading, and conspicuous consumption.

**What to expect:**

-   Heavy FOREX activity
-   Arbitrage between regional price differences
-   Issues defense objectives when attacked
-   Risk-averse military stance

**How to counter:**

-   Beat them at trading (difficult)
-   Disrupt their supply lines
-   Fill their defense objectives to build respect
-   They're not militarily aggressive, but well-funded

## Playbook System

Houses respond to events through **Playbooks**—shopping lists of objectives that any entity can fill.

| Trigger               | House | Playbook Contains                        |
| --------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------- |
| MINE placed           | BLU   | Intel objectives, sabotage objectives    |
| Market deviation +30% | GRN   | Resource objectives, attack objectives   |
| Civilian death        | RED   | Intel objectives, elimination objectives |
| Attack card played    | YLW   | Defense objectives, resource objectives  |

**Fill objectives to earn credit and respect.** Understanding triggers lets you predict incoming playbooks and position yourself to fill high-value objectives first.

## Exploiting House Behaviors

### Setting Traps

-   Place a MINE to trigger BLU intel gathering
-   When BLU sends scouts, ambush them with GRN-style aggression
-   RED won't intervene against military targets

### Market Manipulation

-   Crash a commodity YLW is stockpiling
-   Watch YLW panic-sell at losses
-   Buy the dip, profit from their predictability

### Proxy Wars

-   Fill RED elimination objectives against GRN
-   Let them weaken each other
-   Expand during the distraction

### False Flags

-   Attack civilian assets
-   RED issues elimination objectives against your enemy
-   Fill those objectives yourself for double profit

## Living World

The Protocol Syndicates create a **self-sustaining ecosystem**:

1. GRN attacks create civilian casualties
2. RED issues elimination objectives against GRN
3. Any entity fills those objectives (including you)
4. Conflict creates market volatility
5. YLW profits from volatility
6. BLU stockpiles during low prices
7. Cycle repeats

You can participate in this ecosystem, exploit it, or be consumed by it. **Fill objectives to build respect** and unlock relationship benefits with each house.

**The game runs with or without human players.** You're entering a world that already has its own economy, conflicts, and dynamics.
