# The Four Houses

Four AI-controlled syndicates—called **Protocol Syndicates**—operate in every region. They're not background decoration. They trade, attack, defend, and respond to your actions. Understanding their behaviors is essential to survival.

## Overview

| House | Archetype | Core Drive | Playstyle |
|-------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| <span class="house-blu">**BLU**</span> | The Player | Resource accumulation | Monopolize, hoard, build |
| <span class="house-grn">**GRN**</span> | The Wolf | Harm others | Hunt, disrupt, exploit |
| <span class="house-red">**RED**</span> | The Knight | Protect peace | Punish aggressors, defend |
| <span class="house-ylw">**YLW**</span> | The Pimp | Currency accumulation | Profit, arbitrage, trade |

## House Behaviors

### BLU — The Player

**Philosophy:** "Own everything."

BLU syndicates focus on **resource monopolization**. They corner markets, stockpile commodities, and build extensive infrastructure.

**What to expect:**
- Aggressive market buying, especially when prices dip
- Heavy investment in production buildings
- Territorial expansion to control extraction sites
- Contracts with RED for protection

**How to counter:**
- Compete for extraction sites early
- Crash markets BLU is stockpiling
- Target their supply convoys

---

### GRN — The Wolf

**Philosophy:** "Watch the world burn."

GRN syndicates are **predators**. They hunt for sport, disrupt operations, and exploit chaos.

**What to expect:**
- Frequent HUNT and RAID operations
- Market manipulation to create volatility
- Targeting weak or exposed syndicates
- Opportunistic attacks during other conflicts

**How to counter:**
- Maintain defensive QRF posture
- Keep intel tier high to see attacks coming
- Don't look weak—GRN targets the vulnerable
- Form contracts with RED for protection

---

### RED — The Knight

**Philosophy:** "Justice through force."

RED syndicates are **reactive defenders**. They punish aggressors and protect civilians.

**What to expect:**
- Retaliation against anyone who attacks civilians
- Kill-warrant contracts against aggressive syndicates
- Defensive positioning around non-combatants
- Intervention in ongoing conflicts

**How to counter:**
- Don't trigger RED—avoid civilian casualties
- If you need military action, be surgical
- You can contract RED for defense against GRN
- RED won't attack unprovoked

**Special:** RED contracts are a **second CRD supply source**. When RED issues kill-warrants, they pay out credits, creating regional inflation.

---

### YLW — The Pimp

**Philosophy:** "Everything has a price."

YLW syndicates are **pure capitalists**. They maximize profit through arbitrage, trading, and conspicuous consumption.

**What to expect:**
- Heavy FOREX activity
- Arbitrage between regional price differences
- Contracts with anyone who pays
- Risk-averse military stance

**How to counter:**
- Beat them at trading (difficult)
- Disrupt their supply lines
- YLW contracts are for sale—outbid your enemies
- They're not militarily aggressive, but well-funded

## Playbook System

Houses respond to events through **Playbooks**—automated response triggers.

Example triggers:
| Trigger | House | Response |
|---------|-------|----------|
| MINE placed | BLU | Gather intel, contract RED for sabotage |
| Market deviation +30% | GRN | Execute arbitrage trades |
| Civilian death | RED | Request tribunal kill-warrant |
| Attack card played | YLW | Contract RED for defense |

Understanding these triggers lets you predict—and manipulate—house behavior.

## Exploiting House Behaviors

### Setting Traps
- Place a MINE to trigger BLU intel gathering
- When BLU sends scouts, ambush them with GRN-style aggression
- RED won't intervene against military targets

### Market Manipulation
- Crash a commodity YLW is stockpiling
- Watch YLW panic-sell at losses
- Buy the dip, profit from their predictability

### Proxy Wars
- Contract RED to attack GRN
- Let them weaken each other
- Expand during the distraction

### False Flags
- Attack civilian assets
- RED issues kill-warrants against your enemy
- RED does your dirty work

## Living World

The Protocol Syndicates create a **self-sustaining ecosystem**:

1. GRN attacks create civilian casualties
2. RED issues contracts against GRN
3. Other syndicates take RED contracts
4. Conflict creates market volatility
5. YLW profits from volatility
6. BLU stockpiles during low prices
7. Cycle repeats

You can participate in this ecosystem, exploit it, or be consumed by it.

**The game runs with or without human players.** You're entering a world that already has its own economy, conflicts, and dynamics.
