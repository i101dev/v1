# What is Syndicate Protocol?

**Syndicate Protocol** is a real-time multiplayer strategy game where you build and manage a paramilitary intelligence syndicate competing for regional dominance.

Unlike traditional strategy games where military might wins, **information is your most valuable weapon**. What you know about your enemies—their supply lines, their weak points, their plans—determines whether your operations succeed or fail.

## The Core Loop

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│   EXTRACT → MANUFACTURE → TRADE → RECRUIT → OPERATE → WIN   │
│                                                              │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **Extract Resources** — ENGY, MINR, WATR from controlled territory
2. **Manufacture Commodities** — Turn resources into MEDS, AMMO, FOOD, TOOLS
3. **Trade & Profit** — Sell on markets, execute contracts, exploit FOREX
4. **Recruit & Train** — Build your workforce and military capability
5. **Execute Operations** — HUNT, RAID, KIDNAP, RESCUE, and more
6. **Accumulate Value** — Grow your portfolio to win when time expires

## What Makes It Different

### Information Asymmetry
You can't see everything. Your **Intelligence Tier** determines what you can detect about other syndicates. Low intel? You're operating blind. High intel? You see attacks coming before they arrive.

### Economic Depth
Markets aren't just for buying supplies. They're battlegrounds. Corner the AMMO market before a war. Crash MEDS prices to hurt your enemy's QOL. Use FOREX to move wealth between regions.

### Compounding Advantages
Early moves matter. A Finance Tier advantage in cycle 5 compounds through cycle 60. Tier progression isn't just unlocking features—it's building unstoppable momentum.

### AI Syndicates
Four AI-controlled houses (BLU, GRN, RED, YLW) create a living world. They trade, attack, defend, and respond to your actions. The game runs with or without human players.

## Victory Condition

When the game timer expires, the syndicate with the **highest portfolio value** wins.

Portfolio value = Citizens + Buildings + Resources + Items + Credits + Territory Control + Tier Bonuses

There is no military victory. You can't "eliminate" other syndicates. You win by **accumulating more value** than everyone else—through any means necessary.
