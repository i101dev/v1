# Your First Syndicate

This guide walks you through creating and establishing your first syndicate in Syndicate Protocol.

## Step 1: Create Your Syndicate

When you join a region, you'll create a syndicate:

1. **Choose a Name** — Your syndicate's identity
2. **Select a Faction** — BLU, RED, or GRN alignment (affects starting relationships)
3. **Designate HQ** — Your headquarters location
4. **Set EVAC Point** — Emergency evacuation destination

Upon creation, you receive:
- **5,000 CRD** — Starting credits
- **100 ENGY, MINR, WATR** — Starting resources
- **Designated infrastructure** — PORT, VAULT, basic ENGY buildings

## Step 2: Secure Your First Sector

Your immediate priority: **build a Fortress**.

Fortresses:
- Define the sector you control
- Enable resource extraction in that sector
- Allow building placement
- Provide defensive bonuses

Without a fortress, you're a guest in someone else's territory.

## Step 3: Establish Resource Extraction

With a controlled sector, build extraction buildings:

| Building | Produces | Requires |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Power Plant | ENGY | Citizens |
| Mine | MINR | Citizens, ENGY |
| Purifier | WATR | Citizens, ENGY |

**Tip:** ENGY is foundational. Other extraction requires energy. Prioritize power infrastructure.

## Step 4: Begin Manufacturing

Once resources flow, manufacture commodities:

| Facility | Produces | Input |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Medical Facility | MEDS | WATR, MINR |
| Munitions Plant | AMMO | MINR, ENGY |
| Food Processing | FOOD | WATR, ENGY |
| Tool Factory | TOOLS | MINR, ENGY |

Commodities improve your QOL score, which affects everything from combat to production.

## Step 5: Recruit Citizens

Citizens operate your buildings. More citizens = more production.

Recruitment considerations:
- **Cost** — Citizens cost credits
- **Availability** — Regional population is finite
- **Competition** — Other syndicates recruit from the same pool
- **Quality** — Higher-tier citizens are more effective

Assign citizens to buildings immediately—idle citizens don't produce.

## Step 6: Train Mercenaries

Military capability requires trained mercenaries.

Early priorities:
1. **Recruit mercenary candidates**
2. **Begin RIP (Recruit Initial Processing)** training
3. **Progress through training stages**
4. **Reach operation-capable status**

Training takes cycles. Start early. Mercenaries trained in cycle 5 are available for operations in cycle 15+.

## Step 7: Tier Progression

Invest in tier advancement early. The compounding benefits are substantial.

Initial recommendations:
- **Finance Tier 1** — Unlocks basic market operations
- **Military Tier 1** — Improves training speed
- **Intelligence Tier 1** — Basic detection capability

Don't neglect any tier, but specialize based on strategy.

## Early Game Priorities

### Cycle 1-5
- [ ] Build first Fortress
- [ ] Establish ENGY extraction
- [ ] Recruit initial citizens (aim for 10+)
- [ ] Begin mercenary recruitment

### Cycle 6-15
- [ ] Expand resource extraction (MINR, WATR)
- [ ] Begin commodity manufacturing
- [ ] Achieve Finance Tier 1
- [ ] Mercenaries reach trainable status

### Cycle 16-30
- [ ] Second sector control (second Fortress)
- [ ] Full commodity chain operational
- [ ] Military Tier 1 achieved
- [ ] First offensive operation capability

## Common New Player Mistakes

### 1. Ignoring Energy
Every building needs ENGY. A mineral shortage is annoying. An energy shortage shuts everything down.

### 2. Hoarding Credits
Credits sitting idle don't compound. Invest in tier progression, buildings, and citizens early.

### 3. Late Military Development
Mercenary training takes 20+ cycles to reach full capability. Starting in cycle 30 means being defenseless until cycle 50+.

### 4. Neglecting Intelligence
You can't defend against attacks you don't see coming. Intel Tier 1 is cheap insurance.

### 5. Overexpanding
Two well-developed sectors beat five empty ones. Consolidate before expanding.
