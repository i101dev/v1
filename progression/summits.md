# Summits

Summits are diplomatic events where officers advance tiers. They're essential for progression but involve significant risk.

## How Summits Work

1. **Officer boards convoy** at syndicate HQ
2. **Travels to summit venue** (2 cycles)
3. **Attends summit** with required tribute
4. **Returns to HQ** (2 cycles)

**Total round trip: 6 cycles minimum**

## Summit Types

### Finance Summit
- **Attendee:** Finance Officer
- **Advancement:** Finance Tier
- **Tribute:** Resources and/or EXOT

### Military Summit
- **Attendee:** Military Officer
- **Advancement:** Military Tier
- **Tribute:** Resources and/or EXOT

## The Risk

### Convoy Vulnerability

During transit, officers are exposed:

| Threat | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| HIJK (Hijack) | Convoy intercepted, officer captured |
| KDNP (Kidnap) | Officer specifically targeted |
| Detection | Enemy learns convoy route and contents |

### Losing an Officer

If your officer is kidnapped:
- **No tier advancement** until recovered or replaced
- Enemy can **interrogate** for HQ/evac locations
- Must execute **RSCU** operation to rescue
- Or wait for **replacement** to spawn at HQ

## Risk Mitigation

### Route Masking
- **All SFAS+ escorts** → route masked
- Masked convoys require **Tier 3 intel** to detect
- Most syndicates cannot see masked convoys

### Defensive Multiplier

| Configuration | Defensive Multiplier |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Single officer | 1.75x |
| Both officers | 1.0x (standard) |

Sending officers **separately** gives each a 75% defensive bonus.

### Timing
- Travel during **low-activity periods**
- Avoid summit travel during **active conflicts**
- Coordinate with **allies** for protection

### Intel Investment
- Higher intel tier = **earlier threat detection**
- Tier 3 provides **2-cycle warning**
- Can abort or reroute before interception

## Strategic Considerations

### When to Send Both Officers

**Advantages:**
- Advance two tiers in one trip
- More efficient use of cycles

**Disadvantages:**
- Catastrophic loss if intercepted
- Standard defensive multiplier (1.0x)
- Single point of failure

### When to Send Separately

**Advantages:**
- 75% defensive bonus each
- Only lose one officer if intercepted
- Redundancy

**Disadvantages:**
- Two convoy operations
- More cycles consumed
- More opportunities for detection

## Convoy Timeline

| Cycle | Outbound | Return |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 0 | Launch from HQ | — |
| 1 | In transit | — |
| 2 | Arrive at summit | — |
| 2.5 | Summit attendance | Return convoy created |
| 3 | — | Launch from summit |
| 4 | — | In transit |
| 5 | — | Arrive at HQ |
