# Finance Tier

The Finance Tier determines your economic efficiency. Higher tiers dramatically reduce costs and increase revenue.

## Benefits by Tier

| Finance Tier | Resource Discount | Commodity Subsidy | Contract Premium | FOREX Access |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Tier 0 | 0% | 0% | No access | No |
| Tier 1 | 35% | 60% | 150% market value | Yes |
| Tier 2 | 55% | 80% | 175% market value | Yes |
| Tier 3 | 75% | 95% | 190% market value | Yes |

## Understanding the Discounts

### Resource Discount
Reduces cost when buying ENGY, MINR, WATR from the market.

**Tier 3 Example:** Buy resources at **25% of baseline price** (75% discount)

### Imperial Commodity Subsidy
Additional discount on commodities (MEDS, AMMO, FOOD, TOOLS).

**These stack multiplicatively:**
- Tier 3 resource discount: Pay 25% of base
- Tier 3 commodity subsidy: Pay 5% of that
- **Combined: 0.25 × 0.05 = 1.25% effective cost**

Tier 3 syndicates pay **1/80th** of baseline commodity cost.

### Contract Premium
Higher payment when fulfilling Imperial Defense Contracts.

| Tier | 1,000 CRD Item Contract |
|------|------------------------|
| 1 | 1,500 CRD (+50%) |
| 2 | 1,750 CRD (+75%) |
| 3 | 1,900 CRD (+90%) |
