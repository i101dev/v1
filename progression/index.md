# Tier System

The tier system is how syndicates unlock capabilities and gain compounding advantages. There are three parallel progression tracks: Finance, Military, and Intelligence.

## Why Tiers Matter

**Tiers compound over time.**

A 10% bonus at tier 1 applied over 50 cycles is massive. Early tier investment pays dividends throughout the game.

## The Three Tiers

| Tier Track | Focus | Key Benefits |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| **Finance** | Economics | Market discounts, contract access, FOREX |
| **Military** | Combat | Training speed, success rates, damage control |
| **Intelligence** | Information | Detection range, evidence access, threat alerts |

## Advancement Requirements

Tiers are advanced through **Summit attendance**:

1. Officer travels to summit venue (2 cycles)
2. Attends summit with required tribute
3. Returns to HQ (2 cycles)

**Finance Officer** → Finance Tier advancement
**Military Officer** → Military Tier advancement
**Intelligence Tier** is derived from infrastructure investment

## Tier Benefits Summary

### Finance Tier

| Tier | Resource Discount | Commodity Subsidy | Contract Premium |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 0 | 0% | 0% | No access |
| 1 | 35% | 60% | 150% |
| 2 | 55% | 80% | 175% |
| 3 | 75% | 95% | 190% |

**Tier 3 pays ~1.25% of baseline commodity cost.**

### Military Tier

| Tier | Training Reduction | Success Bonus | Pipeline Duration |
|------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 0 | 0% | +0% | 26 cycles |
| 1 | 15% | +20% | ~22 cycles |
| 2 | 25% | +35% | ~20 cycles |
| 3 | 40% | +50% | ~16 cycles |

**Tier 3 trains mercenaries 40% faster.**

### Intelligence Tier

| Tier | Detection | Rogue ID | Threat Warning |
|------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| 0 | None | 0% | None |
| 1 | Basic | ~25% | None |
| 2 | Enhanced | ~75% | 1 cycle |
| 3 | Full | 100% | 2 cycles |

**Tier 3 sees everything and predicts attacks.**

## Compounding Effects

### Early Investment Example

**Cycle 5: Achieve Finance Tier 1**
- 35% resource discount from cycle 5 onward
- Over 50 remaining cycles, saves 35% on thousands of resource purchases
- Compound savings enable faster expansion

**Cycle 30: Achieve Finance Tier 1**
- Same 35% discount, but only 25 cycles to benefit
- Half the compounding period
- Competitors with early tier lead have overwhelming advantage

## Risk vs Reward

### Summit Travel Risk
Officers must physically travel to summits:
- 2 cycles each way (6 cycle round trip)
- Vulnerable to interception during transit
- Losing an officer halts tier advancement

### Mitigation Strategies
- Route masking (SFAS+ escorts)
- Send officers separately
- Time travel during low-activity periods
- Intel investment for threat detection
