## How Victory Works

The syndicate with the **most valuable portfolio** when time expires wins. Your portfolio includes:

- **Citizens** — Recruited assets assigned to buildings
- **Buildings** — Production facilities, military installations, fortresses
- **Resources** — ENGY, MINR, WATR stockpiles
- **Items** — Manufactured goods and equipment
- **Credits** — Liquid currency
- **Territory** — Sectors under your control
- **Tier Advantages** — Compounding bonuses from institutional advancement

Games run for **60+ cycles**. Early moves compound. Late-game catching up is possible but costly.
