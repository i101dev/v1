# Economy Overview

The economic system in Syndicate Protocol isn't just about accumulating wealth—it's a weapon. Markets can be manipulated, supply chains disrupted, and currency itself weaponized against your enemies.

## Economic Layers

Syndicate Protocol has **three distinct economic layers**, each with different mechanics and strategic implications:

| Layer | What It Is | How You Get It | Strategic Role |
|-------|------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Resources** | Raw materials (ENGY, MINR, WATR) | Extraction from territory | Production inputs |
| **Commodities** | Imperial goods (MEDS, AMMO, FOOD, TOOLS) | Purchase from Empire with resources | QOL improvement |
| **Credits (CRD)** | Universal currency | Market trading, contracts | Transaction medium |

## The Economic Loop

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                 │
│   TERRITORY → EXTRACTION → RESOURCES → COMMODITIES → QOL       │
│       ↑                                                   │     │
│       └───────────────── MILITARY POWER ←─────────────────┘     │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **Control territory** to access extraction sites
2. **Extract resources** (ENGY, MINR, WATR) from controlled sectors
3. **Convert resources** to commodities via Imperial purchase
4. **Distribute commodities** to improve regional QOL
5. **Higher QOL** amplifies military effectiveness (up to 5.8x)
6. **Stronger military** enables territorial expansion
7. **Cycle repeats** with compounding advantages

## Infrastructure Requirements

All market transactions require physical infrastructure:

| Building | Code | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| **Port** | PORT | Physical movement of goods |
| **Vault** | VALT | CRD transaction processing |

**Without PORT:** Cannot buy or sell goods (no logistics capability)
**Without VALT:** Cannot process payments (no financial infrastructure)

Destroying enemy PORTs cuts them off from markets entirely.

## Finance Tier Impact

Your Finance Tier dramatically affects economic efficiency:

| Finance Tier | Resource Discount | Commodity Subsidy | Contract Premium |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Tier 0 | 0% | 0% | No access |
| Tier 1 | 35% | 60% | 150% market value |
| Tier 2 | 55% | 80% | 175% market value |
| Tier 3 | 75% | 95% | 190% market value |

**Tier 3 syndicates pay ~1.25% of baseline commodity costs** while earning 190% on defense contracts. This creates massive compounding advantage.

## Economic Warfare Tactics

### Market Manipulation
- **Corner the market** — Buy up AMMO before declaring war
- **Crash prices** — Dump resources to destroy enemy margins
- **Arbitrage** — Exploit FOREX rate differences between regions

### Supply Chain Attacks
- **Hijack convoys** — Intercept enemy resource shipments
- **PORT destruction** — Cut off market access entirely
- **Contract denial** — Claim Imperial contracts before competitors

### Currency Warfare
- **Inflation attacks** — Inject CRD into enemy regions
- **Deflation traps** — Drain CRD through favorable FOREX trades
- **ITSB exploitation** — Use strong currency to systematically extract value
